# The Cocktail DB web application

The Cocktail DB web application allows user to search for cocktails and check information about them in detail (ingredients, instruction for making them, etc).

It is a basic and small react project, but it uses some key features, like:
- useEffect, useCallback, useState, useContext, useRef hooks.
- React context.
- React router.
- Custom hooks.
- Some other non react features like CSS with variables.
